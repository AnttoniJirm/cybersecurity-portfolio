Objective

Simulate a privilege escalation caused by a misconfigured sudoers entry and investigate the activity using auditd and Wazuh to correlate host-level forensic evidence with SIEM alerts.

Environment

HostRoleIPOSKali Linux 2026.1Attacker192.168.20.11KaliUbuntu 22.04 LTSTarget / Wazuh Manager192.168.20.10 (hostname: Ubuntu2)Wazuh 4.7.5

All hosts reside on an isolated internal lab network (labnet), with no external connectivity.

Vulnerability / Misconfiguration

A misconfiguration was introduced into /etc/sudoers (via visudo) for the local user hacker (uid 1001):

hacker ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/bash

This entry grants hacker the ability to obtain a full, interactive root shell without re-authenticating — a broad NOPASSWD rule granting unrestricted access to /bin/bash. This type of misconfiguration is commonly introduced when administrators grant wide sudo access instead of scoping rules to specific, necessary commands.

Detection Setup (auditd)

An audit rule was configured on the Ubuntu host to track privilege escalation activity:

sudo /sbin/auditctl -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -F euid=0 -F auid!=0 -k privilege_escalation

FlagMeaningarch=b64Monitor 64-bit syscalls-S execveTrack all program execution events-F euid=0Only events where the effective UID is 0 (root)-F auid!=0Exclude actions performed natively under root's own login session-k privilege_escalationTag matching events for retrieval via ausearch

This rule does not prevent escalation — it records a forensic trail that survives privilege changes, because the auid (audit user ID / login UID) field is set at login time and remains immutable for the entire session, even after sudo changes the effective and real UID.

What this rule detects:

ScenarioDetected?sudo /bin/bash✓ Yessudo su✓ Yessudo vim / sudo nano✓ YesAny command executed as euid=0 by a non-root login✓ YesCommands run by a user without sudo✗ No (euid stays non-root)Direct root login✗ No (auid=0 is excluded)

Steps executed:


SSH from Kali into the Ubuntu host as hacker:
ssh hacker@192.168.20.10
Confirmed the sudoers misconfiguration: sudo -l
Escalated to a root shell: sudo /bin/bash
Verified privilege change: whoami / id → uid=0(root) (was uid=1001(hacker))

Wazuh Alerts

Wazuh's sudo/PAM log decoder (reading /var/log/auth.log) generated the following alerts on each successful escalation:

RuleDescriptionLevel5402Successful sudo to ROOT executed35501PAM: Login session opened35502PAM: Login session closed3

Rule 5402 fired consistently across the testing window (17:37, 17:39, 17:43, 17:53 on Jun 29, and again on Jun 30 after the host was restarted), confirming reliable detection across sessions.

Note on Rule 5403: Wazuh also ships Rule 5403 ("First time user executed sudo"), which fires exactly once per user account — on the very first successful sudo invocation ever recorded. Because hacker's sudo access was already exercised while validating the misconfiguration (sudo -l) earlier in the lab setup, Rule 5403 had already fired before this documented incident window. This is expected behavior given how the rule is designed, not a detection gap.

Forensic Evidence (auditd / ausearch)

On the Ubuntu host, the auditd trail was queried directly:

sudo ausearch -k privilege_escalation --interpret | grep -E "time|exe|auid|euid|comm"

Representative output:

type=SYSCALL ... auid=hacker uid=root gid=root euid=root suid=root ... comm=sh exe=/usr/bin/dash key=privilege_escalation


Why auid matters:

auid  = hacker   ← the human who authenticated via SSH
uid   = root     ← what sudo changed it to
euid  = root     ← effective UID at time of syscall

Even though the process is running as root, auid continues to read hacker for the entire session. This allows an investigator to definitively trace any privileged action — even commands executed after sudo /bin/bash — back to the original account. This is the core forensic value of auditd in this scenario: auth.log alone confirms that a sudo escalation occurred, but only auditd confirms who initiated it at syscall level.

Incident Summary

A user with low-privilege SSH access (hacker) was able to obtain a full root shell on the Ubuntu host due to an overly permissive sudoers entry granting NOPASSWD access to /bin/bash. The escalation was detected through two independent layers: Wazuh's sudo log decoder (Rule 5402, real-time SIEM alert) and Linux Audit's syscall-level tracking (host-level forensic trail via ausearch). Together, these confirm both that an escalation occurred and who the originating user was — even after the UID changed to root.

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

FieldValueTacticPrivilege EscalationTechniqueT1548 — Abuse Elevation Control MechanismSub-techniqueT1548.003 — Sudo and Sudo Caching

This sub-technique covers adversaries abusing the sudoers configuration to execute commands as another user (typically root) without re-authentication. It is intentionally distinct from T1068 (Exploitation for Privilege Escalation), which requires exploitation of a software vulnerability or kernel/binary flaw. This scenario involves no such vulnerability — the system granted elevated access exactly as configured. The misconfiguration made that grant overly broad; there was no code being exploited.

Recommendations


Remove NOPASSWD entries from /etc/sudoers and /etc/sudoers.d/; require authentication for all sudo invocations.
Scope sudo grants to specific, necessary commands only — never to /bin/bash, /bin/sh, or other shell binaries.
Periodically audit /etc/sudoers and /etc/sudoers.d/ for unauthorized or overly permissive entries.
Consider sudo I/O logging (Defaults log_input,log_output) for full session-level visibility into privileged commands executed after escalation.
Persist auditd rules under /etc/audit/rules.d/ (loaded via augenrules --load) rather than relying on auditctl alone, which does not survive a reboot.


Lessons Learned

auid is the most reliable attribution field. It does not change even after sudo modifies the effective and real UID. An investigator can always trace root-level activity back to the originating account as long as auditd is running and the session was initiated interactively.

Broad audit filters generate noise. The filter -F auid!=0 also matches the "unset" sentinel value (auid=-1) used for non-interactive, daemon-spawned processes — not only real interactive users. In this lab, Wazuh's own internal subprocess execution (df, sed, sort, last) was tagged with the same privilege_escalation key as the actual attacker activity. A more precise rule targeting only real human logins would use:

-F auid>=1000 -F auid!=-1

Custom audit keys do not auto-surface in Wazuh. Wazuh's default auditd ruleset only generates a named dashboard alert for conventional, CDB-listed audit keys (e.g., audit-wazuh-c, audit-wazuh-w). A custom key such as privilege_escalation is fully visible at the host level via ausearch, but does not automatically appear as a named alert in the Wazuh dashboard unless a custom rule is added to local_rules.xml matching that key. Rule 5402 (from auth.log) covered detection in this lab — but in a production environment, adding a custom rule to surface auditd key matches directly in the SIEM would provide a more complete and automated detection pipeline.
